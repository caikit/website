# Contributing to Caikit
{: .no_toc }

When contributing to Caikit, we suggest to first read the [Caikit Community Contributor Guide](https://github.com/caikit/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and then check out the guide to the specific project in the community that you are contributing to. For example, [Caikit Contributor Guide](https://github.com/caikit/caikit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), [Caikit NLP Contributor Guide](https://github.com/caikit/caikit-nlp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and so on.

The [Development Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/developing.md %}) page has in-depth information about setting up development environments and tooling.
